# Learning: DOM-manipulation

## Description of the Assignment
For this assignment, I created a replica web page for Rock Werchter, one of Belgium's most famous music festivals. The goal was to learn and apply DOM manipulation techniques using JavaScript to develop an interactive and informative web page for festival-goers.

## About the Application
The Rock Werchter replica web page provides all the necessary information for festival-goers, including the lineup, main navigation, a countdown clock to the next edition, and detailed concert information. The main navigation is designed to enhance user experience by providing easy access to various parts of the website, such as the lineup and additional festival details. External links open in new tabs for user convenience.

### Features
- **Lineup Section**: Displays all the artists performing at the festival, along with their stage, description, social media links, and images. The information is dynamically loaded via JavaScript to keep the page interactive and current.
- **Countdown Clock**: An exciting countdown clock that updates every second, counting down to the next edition of Rock Werchter.
- **Concert Details**: When a user clicks on a specific concert, detailed information is displayed in a separate container. This includes the full description of the concert and links to social media, if available.
- **Overlay for Concert Information**: An overlay feature that displays detailed concert information, adding a visually appealing element to the user interface.

### Skills Learned
- **DOM Manipulation**: Learned to dynamically update the content of the web page using JavaScript.
- **JavaScript Functionality**: Prioritized the functionality of JavaScript to create interactive and dynamic elements.
- **CSS Styling**: Used CSS to give the page an attractive and consistent appearance.
